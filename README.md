# Airport Management System
## Problem or question ? (why)
here we go the problem
Airports are exciting as it means traveling to a place we have never been, which can be strange to
some. There are a million things that can go wrong from check in to boarding, even at arrivals, so
anything can be expected while travelling.
## answers or solution (because)
Every problem is fixable. Airline would want you to fly with them again, to be their potential
customer and airport staff are there to assist you if there's any type of issue. They will make sure
they assist you to prevent having bad review. Therefore, we have decided to work on an Airport
Management System, a system which will have the control of an airport or will show the overview
of all the operations in the airport.
